## Hi, I'm Jackson.

I make things. 

I'm also a:

* Student @ UNT
* Software Engineer at New Light Technoligies ([@NLTGit](//github.com/NLTGit))
  * There, I've worked on the [Geo4Dev initiative's new website](//geo4.dev).
* Computer Science Tutor @ Wyzant
  * (but I don't do much of that at the moment)

Reach out if you have any questions!
