## Hi, I'm Jackson.

I make things. 

I'm also a:

* Student @ UNT
  * Pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science. Shocking, I know.
  * I have a 4.0 GPA.
  * I'll probably be graduating in Spring 2023.
* SDE Intern @ AWS
* [ inactive ] [Software Engineer](https://newlighttechnologies.com/staff/jackson-welsh/) @ New Light Technoligies ([@NLTGit](//github.com/NLTGit))
  * There, I was the lead developer of the [Geo4Dev initiative's new website](//geo4.dev).
  * I worked on a web mapping application, written in Vue.js, for SpatialFocus's address management suite.
  * And I helped overhaul the US Army Corps of Engineers' [USMART](https://usmart.usace.army.mil/) application, writing it in React with TypeScript. 


Things I've done in the past:

* For about a year, I was a computer science tutor @ Wyzant, teaching students from middle school up to approx. 2000-level college courses.
* I'm an Eagle Scout.
* I formerly held a consulting role @ NLT, but am now an employee.
